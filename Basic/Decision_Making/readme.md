# Decision Making
This repository explores decision-making structures in basic Python programming.  It covers conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and related concepts, providing clear examples and explanations to help beginners understand how to control the flow of their Python programs.

## What is Decision Making?

Decision making is a fundamental aspect of programming. It allows your programs to execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met.  In Python, this is primarily achieved using conditional statements.

## Conditional Statements

This repository focuses on the following conditional statements:

* **`if` statement:**  Executes a block of code only if a condition is true.

  ```python
  x = 10
  if x > 5:
      print("x is greater than 5")
