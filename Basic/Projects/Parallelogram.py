# Asking for base and radius to find out its area
base = float(input("Enter the base of the parallelogram: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the parallelogram: "))

# Executing Formula of finding area of parallelogram which is base X Height or b X h
area = base * height

# Telling what is the area of the base and height given by the user.
print(f"The area of the parallelogram is {area}")

# ---------------------------- Output ---------------------------- #
# Enter the base of the parallelogram: 5
# Enter the height of the parallelogram: 6
# The area of the parallelogram is 30.0
