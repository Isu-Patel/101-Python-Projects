# Calling APIs with API Keys

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to calling APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) using API keys.  It covers various methods and best practices for securely and effectively interacting with APIs that require authentication.

## What are APIs and API Keys?

* **API (Application Programming Interface):**  A set of rules and specifications that allow software applications to communicate with each other.  APIs define how different components of a software system or different software systems interact.

* **API Key:**  A unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize a user or application when making requests to an API.  API keys are typically used to track usage, prevent abuse, and control access to API resources.

## Methods for Calling APIs with API Keys

This repository demonstrates several ways to include API keys in your API requests:

### 1. Header Authentication (Recommended)

This is the most common and generally recommended method.  The API key is included in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request.

```python
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key
api_url = "[https://api.example.com/data](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://api.example.com/data)"  # Replace with the API endpoint

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"  # Or "ApiKey {api_key}" depending on the API
}

response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    # Process the data
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)  # Print the error message from the API
