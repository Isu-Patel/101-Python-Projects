# Web Scraping with Python

This repository provides a practical guide to web scraping using Python. It covers various techniques and libraries for extracting data from websites, along with best practices and ethical considerations.

## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the HTML content of a web page and then parsing that content to extract the desired information.  Web scraping can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Data collection and analysis
* Price comparison
* Market research
* Monitoring changes on websites
* Building datasets for machine learning

## Libraries for Web Scraping

This repository primarily uses the following Python libraries:

* **Beautiful Soup:** A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree that can be navigated and searched.
* **Requests:** A library for making HTTP requests to fetch the HTML content of web pages.
* **Scrapy (Optional):** A powerful and flexible framework for building web scrapers.  It's particularly useful for larger and more complex scraping projects.
* **Selenium (Optional):** A tool for automating web browsers.  It's used for scraping websites that use JavaScript to load content dynamically.

## Basic Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup and Requests

This section demonstrates the basic steps involved in web scraping using Beautiful Soup and Requests:

1. **Fetching the HTML content:**

```python
import requests

url = "[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)"  # Replace with the target URL
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    html_content = response.content
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
