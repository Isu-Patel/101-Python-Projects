# Loops - A Collection of Loop Utility Functions (and Examples)

This repository provides a collection of Python functions and examples related to working with loops, specifically focusing on `for` and `while` loops. While Python's built-in loop structures are already powerful and flexible, this repository offers some helpful patterns, demonstrations, and potential utility functions for common looping scenarios.

## What are Loops?

Loops in Python are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.  Python provides two primary types of loops:

* **`for` loops:** Used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable object.
* **`while` loops:** Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition remains true.

## Features & Functionality (and Examples)

This repository focuses on demonstrating and explaining various loop patterns and techniques, rather than providing a large number of wrapper functions (as most common looping tasks are easily handled directly with Python's built-in loops).

Here are some key concepts and examples covered:

### For Loops

* **Basic Iteration:**
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
